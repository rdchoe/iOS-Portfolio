# Google - Family Link App &nbsp;<img src="https://github.com/rdchoe/iOS-Portfolio/blob/master/flicon.png" width="50" height="50">
In my Summer 2019 internship at Google, I worked on building out the UI for Family Link's Per App Time Limt (PATL) Feature. This feature request consisted of building out three main components. The first component was a new dashboard card to display App usage and limit status. The second component was adding the ability to sort and filter apps based on a set number of options. The third component was adding a segment control component to navigate between two pages within the same view.

# Volvo Group - Volvo Predictive Maintenance Prototype App
In my Summer 2018 internship at Volvo group, I worked on building out an IoT (Internet of Things) solution on the shop floor. This project consisted of creating and setting up vibration sensors on critical motors and sending the data to a cloud platform. As an extension of the project, I created a protoype app to display analytics and vibration data from the cloud platform the data was being sent to.

As class project for CMSC436 (Mobile Programming), I worked with two other colleagues to build out an application to help students organize their daily routines. The apps consists of multiple trackers an average student might find useful. This application was created in xCode and developed in Swift and used the cocoa framework.
